<h2> Malaria Parasitisation detection using blood smear images </h2>


Developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow to classify blood smear images into parasitised and uninfected.
Utilised the Malaria Cell Images Dataset, comprising 27,558 annotated blood smear images.
Preprocessed the dataset to enhance model performance, including resizing, normalisation, and augmentation techniques.
Designed and implemented a CNN architecture tailored for malaria parasite detection and fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimise model performance and generalisation.
Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
